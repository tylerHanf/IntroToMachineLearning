This code graphs basic machine learning aspects
with linear regression.

It demonstrate how each step approaches the target
function with a decreasing error rate and smaller
adjustments as the learning function approaches 
the desired function.

*Note: This code is for basic teaching purposes,
so do not run a large number of training steps,
the code is not designed for it. The max number
of training steps should be about 75-100 depending
on the machine.

The Graph class is used for easily graphing very 
basic plots. It is designed for making one figure
with a variable number of subplots and a variable
pause time both based on user input.
